This is a modified version of this code: http://sphinx.mythic-beasts.com/~markt/RPi-openCV-Kinect.html
Don't forget to add the modprobe to rc.local

However, [this](https://docs.opencv.org/3.2.0/d7/d6f/tutorial_kinect_openni.html) appears to be a wholey OpenCV version. However, haven't gotten it to work.
